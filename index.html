        <p>
            ‚ÄúWhen security risks in web services are discovered by independent security
            researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they often lack the
            channels to disclose them properly. As a result, security issues may be left
            unreported. security.plist defines a standard to help organizations define the
            process for security researchers to disclose security vulnerabilities securely.‚Äù

        <h5>What is the main purpose of security.plist?</h5>
        <p>The main purpose of security.plist is to help make things easier for companies and security researchers when trying to secure platforms. Thanks to security.plist, security researchers can easily get in touch with companies about security issues.</p>
        <h5>Where should I put the security.plist file?</h5>
        <p>For iOS applications, the security.plist file should be placed at the root of <code>.xcodeproj</code> or <code>.xcworkspace</code> project files.
		<h5>Are there any settings I should apply to the file?</h5>
		<p>The security.plist file should be at least <code>plist version="1.0"</code>.</p>
        <h5>Will adding an email address expose me to spam bots?</h5>
        <p>The email value is an optional field. If you are worried about spam, you can set a URI as the value and link to your security policy.</p>
