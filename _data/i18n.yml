    about: When security risks in web services are discovered by independent security researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they often lack the channels to properly disclose them. As a result, security issues may be left unreported. security.plist defines a standard to help organizations define the process for security researchers to securely disclose security vulnerabilities.
